WiseMoney is a web application which aim is to allow users to categorize their payments. 

Future plans were to include a mobile application (or just the website) and add offers from shops that are near to the user of the application.

There are two user types for the application: Agencies (places, shops, etc...) and normal users (consumers, or just people who want to see some analytics about their paying habits.)
